# Conformity Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **Conformity Dashboard** is part of an MVP for tracking user-specific compliance metrics. The dashboard component is built using **React.js** and **TypeScript** on the front end, while the back end uses **Node.js** and **Express.js** to serve mock compliance data. It displays metrics such as the compliance score, controls implemented, and pending tasks in an interactive and visually appealing way.

## Features
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Displays compliance metrics using charts.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Clean, modern interface built with Material-UI.
- **API Integration**: Simulates data fetching from a back-end API.
- **Refresh Button**: Allows the user to refresh the compliance data dynamically.

## Technologies Used
### Front-End
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Material-UI for design components
- Chart.js for interactive charts

### Back-End
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios for data fetching

## Installation and Setup

### 1. Clone the Repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/k-thakor/Conformity-Assessment.git
cd Conformity-Assessment
```
### 2. Run Backend
```bash
cd backend
npm install
npm server.js
```
The backend should now be running on http://localhost:5000.

### 3. Run Frontend
```bash
cd frontend
npm install
npm start
```
The frontend should now be running on http://localhost:3000.

## Usage
