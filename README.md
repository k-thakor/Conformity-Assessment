# Conformity Dashboard

## Project Overview
The **Conformity Dashboard** is part of an MVP for tracking user-specific compliance metrics. The dashboard component is built using **React.js** and **TypeScript** on the front end, while the back end uses **Node.js** and **Express.js** to serve mock compliance data. It displays metrics such as the compliance score, controls implemented, and pending tasks in an interactive and visually appealing way.

## Features
- **Interactive Data Visualization**: Displays compliance metrics using charts.
- **User-Friendly UI**: Clean, modern interface built with Material-UI.
- **API Integration**: Simulates data fetching from a back-end API.
- **Refresh Button**: Allows the user to refresh the compliance data dynamically.

## Technologies Used
### Front-End
- React.js
- TypeScript
- Material-UI for design components
- Chart.js for interactive charts

### Back-End
- Node.js
- Express.js
- Axios for data fetching
